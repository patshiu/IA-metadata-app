        Wonderfully trippy little cartoon on the function of computers. The color's a little muddy, but it explains the use of computers--in the service of man, not its master--as a tool for the control of information and work, design, and for simulating reality.

Not sure what need this short really fulfills, but it's fun (kinda like a Fractured Fairytale-style), doesn't pander, and doesn't panic.

        I'm not the biggest fan of the Eames' work. For some odd reason, I find they're animated stories stiff and too formal. In the case of The Information Machine, it's a cartoon about computers told somewhat straight forward as the Eames can tell it. The animation isn't all THAT great, one thing that does save it is the score by Elmer Bernstein.
